PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
To effectively help students understand the General Theory of Relativity and Universal Law of Graviation better.

VERSION or DATE: 1.0
LICENSE: GNU 3.0

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
OPEN THE PROJECT ON GREENFOOT, AND HIT "RUN."

AUTHOR: JOHN SEONG

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The main goal of this game is to contain the asteroid within the window box, but not to collide with the Earth.
This can be done by tinkering with the Earth's mass, which leads to the variation in the strength of the gravity.
2. Remember the simple law: when the mass increases, the magnitude of the gravity gets larger as it bends more space and time.
This leads to a phenomenon where the attraction force between the asteroid and the celestial object (which, in this case, Earth) increases.

WHY THIS PROJECT DESERVES A 4+:
1. It utilizes the famous Univeral Law of Gravitation equation (Gmm/r^2) to generate this beautiful but tricky orbital mechanics simulation.
It also demonstrates great level of optimization by featuring blazingly fast calculation performance despite it not being written in lower level languages such as C++.
2. By providing a visual aid for students who might be taking Gr. 12 Physics, it helps them understand the concepts much faster and clearer than the textbook.
