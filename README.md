USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The main goal of this game is to contain the asteroid within the window box, but not to collide with the Earth.
This can be done by tinkering with the Earth's mass, which leads to the variation in the strength of the gravity.
2. Remember the simple law: when the mass increases, the magnitude of the gravity gets larger as it bends more space and time.
This leads to a phenomenon where the attraction force between the asteroid and the celestial object (which, in this case, Earth) increases.
